# Most-Profitable-Apps-iOS-Android

## Overview
### Background and Aim
In this project, we are working as data analysts for a company that develops free-to-download Android and iOS mobile apps. 
Our primary revenue source is in-app advertisements, making user engagement crucial for our financial success. 
The goal of this project is to analyze data to guide our developers on the types of apps that are likely to attract a larger user base.

### Steps Taken
1. **Data Collection**
	- Utilized datasets from Kaggle:
		- A dataset containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play (collected in August 2018).
		- A dataset containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store (collected in July 2017).
2. **Data Exploration**
	- Opened and explored the datasets to understand their structure and content.
3. **Data Cleaning**
	- Removed duplicates and detected and deleted inaccurate or irrelevant data, focusing on:
		- Non-English apps.
		- Apps that are not free.
4. **Genre Analysis**
	- Analyzed the most common genres for each market:
		- Used a frequency table for the "prime_genre" column of the App Store dataset.
		- Used the "Genres" and "Category" columns of the Google Play dataset.
5. **Conclusion**
	- Identified that converting popular books into apps could be a profitable strategy for both Google Play and the App Store markets.
	- Suggested adding special features to book apps to stand out in the saturated market, such as:
		- Daily quotes from the book.
		- An audio version of the book.
		- Quizzes on the book.
		- A forum for discussions about the book.
